 * A function type that creates a Template from a TemplateResult.
 *
 * This is a hook into the template-creation process for rendering that
 * requires some modification of templates before they're used, like ShadyCSS,
 * which must add classes to elements and remove styles.
 *
 * Templates should be cached as aggressively as possible, so that many
 * TemplateResults produced from the same expression only do the work of
 * creating the Template the first time.
 *
 * Templates are usually cached by TemplateResult.strings and
 * TemplateResult.type, but may be cached by other keys if this function
 * modifies the template.
 *
 * Note that currently TemplateFactories must not add, remove, or reorder
 * expressions, because there is no way to describe such a modification
 * to render() so that values are interpolated to the correct place in the
 * template instances.
